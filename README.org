#+title: Pacman in J2ME
#+startup: hidestars

/This is my old student project from 2010./

This is a pacman clone built in few days as a student project for Simulations and Control of Discrete Processes course.

The project was oriented to stay as close to the original look&feel of Pacman as possible.

It features a map editor written in Excel, basic AI and some cheats available via Konami code.

I run the project on Sony Ericsson K800i.
